    "City planning is the planning and designing of a city so that it can best control and facilitate economic growth, technological developments, and a sustainable population. Various aspects of city planning include the zoning of land for specific use only, regulating how space is used, what buildings can go on specific plots of land, how many fire and police stations within each block, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2016, Y combinator, one of the biggest tech startup incubator in the world that helped launch companies like Dropbox and Airbnb, announced their project of building the \"New Cities\" project that intended to build a completely new city from scratch.[1] Building a new city from the ground up is not a radically new idea. In 2015, the Egyptian housing minister Mostafa Madbouly announced that they will begin building a new city that is located 45 killometers east of Cairo and outside of the Second Greater Cairo Ring Road.[2] In addition, games such as the SimCity series are primarily based on the concept of urban development and city planning. Whilst not realistic, these games provide a “sandbox” that allows players to create a magic city.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating these magical cities may seem like a simple task, however, when it comes to optimizing the most economically productive or most attractive city, there are many variables to consider. Land, tax rates, budgets, policies, and types of buildings are just a few that must be considered when planning out the “best” metropolis to build. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, we will not be taking into account all of these concerns. Our project will instead be focusing on optimizing simplified magic cities before we try to tackle or discuss future additions or problems for more realistic models.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, however, there are ways we can model a simplified city and project its economic output or attractiveness for people to come and live in it. We can do this starting with the current plot of land or city. From there, we can evaluate its budget based on current economic output and population, and after putting a number to the year’s budget, then we can calculate the value each type of building will bring us. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part of this project, we will be tackling the challange of building the new King Abdullah Economic City.[3] This is a megaproject that was announced by the then-king of Saudi Arabia Al Saud. This project was created to promote industrial expansion, diversify economy, and to provide housing and job opportunities for a yound population. We chose this project because the landarea and the budgets are relatively bigger to work with. The total landarea for this project is around 181km^2 (44726.1 acres), and the intended population is around 2 millions, and the budget is over \\$100 billion dollars. \n",

In our simple model, we measure each of these for a building on a scale from -10 to 10.

    "  (A) This constraint ensures that the base city exists in the middle of the map and that the outside (or border) of the world is empty. The base city exists so that the next iteration can grow from it, and the border being empty aids in perimeter calculation in constraint F. $W_\\text{base}$ is a subset of the world $W$ that specifies these constraints, and $b_{i,j,k}$ are the values that the base city takes for each value in $W_\\text{base}$.\n",

    "  \n",
    "  (E) This is the first nontrivial constraint. It causes a phenomenon of zoning. Zoning is where certain areas of a community are reserved for certain types of buildings. For example, there can be residential zones or business zones. In order to implement this into our example, we ensure that types of buildings must form **continguous** areas. This is represented in the constraint by not letting type $t$ of a building be built **unless** there is one of type $k$ surrounding it. Note that this does not prevent multiple zones of the same type; rather it just ensures that buildings are present in only in 'groups' which can be though of as zones. $W_\\text{inner}$ represents the inner world (i.e. the world without the border). We only sum over these squares since the border is defined to be zero.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  (F) This constraint builds upon constraint (E). As a whole, it prevents regions from being strangley shaped by ensuring a proper ratio of perimeter to area. The expression on the left calculates the perimeter of each of the contiguous building regions for a given building type k. The right side's summation calculates the area of the continguous building regions for a given type k. The corresponding ratio is represented by $R$. The proper value of R is not immediately obvious, so it was experimentally determined during development.\n",

    "Here we discuss the details of the perimeter calculation $\\sum_{w_{i,j,k} \\in W} (4w_{i,j,k} - w_{i-1,j,k} - w_{i+1,j,k} - w_{i,j+1,k} - w_{i,j-1,k})$, where type $k$ is a given constant.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The formula is easier to understand if rearranged as $\\sum_{w_{i,j,k} \\in W} ((w_{i,j,k} - w_{i-1,j,k}) + (w_{i,j,k}-w_{i+1,j,k}) + (w_{i,j,k}-w_{i,j+1,k}) + (w_{i,j,k}-w_{i,j-1,k}))$.\n",
    "Here, we are taking the sum of the differences between $w_{i,j,k}$ and each one of its adjacent sides, for a given class k. This way, buildings that are adjecent to other buildings of the same type will have a difference of zero. Furthermore, when the adjacent buildings are of different types, the difference will be 1 (1 - 0, with the 1 coming from the base building and the 0 from the bordering building of a different or no type). This way, for every square, the number of bordering squares of the same type are calculated. Thus, this calculates a perimeter for each type of building."

    "Having modeled a simplified version of city planning, we can see that these cities are not realistic. Part of this is the simplicity of the \"buildings\" we chose. If someone wanted to, it would not be difficult to add in significantly more buildings and a larger area then we did in this model. When adding more buildings it would also be benificial to split them into two groups. The first group would be treated like the majority of buildings in this model, meaning buildings that are often put together like farms and homes. The other group would be like the hospital, where it separated from others of the same type and within a certain distance to all other buildings. In this model we also made everything a single size, in real life this wouldn't happen so another improvement could be to add land area to each building. These would all be realitively simple things that would improve the model. There are many more complicated things that could be added to make it more realistic and some of those ideas are listed below: \n",
    "- Going into debt\n",
    "- Dynamic tax rates for the budget\n",
    "- Allowing for the deconstruction of buildings\n",
    "- Expanding districts. \n",
    "- Make neighboring building's \"relationship\" matter more\n",
    "  - ie. Make farms or mines want to be away from everything. Shops and restaraunts want to form a commercial district\n",
    "- Population dependent attractiveness for buildings\n",
    "  - As populations grow: \n",
    "    - Certain buildings become more attractive \n",
    "      - Offices, Appartments, Entertainment, Service Industry Structures\n",
    "    - Other buildings become less attractive or want to be farther away from the population\n",
    "      - Factories, Mines, Farms\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of model, given some creative license, can also be applied to areas outside of city planning. A few examples could be:\n",
    "- Park Design\n",
    " - Much like a city, a park can have certain structures that may be more or less attractive depending on who it's built for. The park can then choose its \"topic(s)\" that will serve as zones and build an ideal map based on this\n",
    "- Interior Building Design\n",
    " - A building has certain utilities, and everything needs to not only be accessable but also be convient to access to. Additionally, some structures may improve the quality of life when using/occupying the building, so an ideal building design would want to balance the use of space with the functionality of it\n",
    "- Vehicle Design\n",
    " - A given vehicle must be made to match some specific standards, be cost-effective, be attractive, and last a long time. Given a set of parts or some material, one could design a vehicle from some material to meet all of the requirements in the best possible manner.\n",
    "- Schedule Creator\n",
    " - Given a list of things to be done with locations, duration, and \"priority\" we can use the same model here to block in a week long schedule of what to do"
