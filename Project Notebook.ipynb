    "The first few sentences should give a quick overview of the entire project. Then, elaborate with a description of the problem that will be solved, a brief history (with [citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation)) of how the problem came about, why it's important/interesting, and any other interesting facts you'd like to talk about. You should address and explain where the problem data is coming from (research? the internet? synthetically generated?) Also give an outline of the rest of the report.\n",

    "  In our model, $x = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_t)$ represents a vector of the number of each of the t types of buildings possible. Clearly, each of these values are integers.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  $P, A, \\text{and } C$ also represent similar quanitities, where $P = (p_1, p_2, ... p_n)$ and similar for $A$ and $C$. They are also t-dimensional vectors with the ith entry corresponding to the ith type of building. For a given building type i, $c_i$ represents the cost of constructing a building, $p_i$ represents the annual profit, and $a_i$ represents the attractiveness. In our simple model, we measure each of these for a building on a scale from -10 to 10. Negative numbers represent cost rather than profit, and \"ugliness\" rather than attractiveness (note: there cannot be a negative cost for constructing a building).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  $X_{\\text{min}}$ represents the minimum per person requirements for each building. Like $x$, it is t-dimensional for each of the minimum requirements for the t buildings. For clarity, we represent $X_{\\text{min}}$ in number of buildings per 1,000 people. Furthermore, $p$ represents the number of people or population the city must be able to support.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Since our decision variables (the number of buildings) must be positive integers, the problem is a MIP. In our model, we essentially are trying the maximize the annual \"value\" of a city given a certain budget for **completely** constructing it."

    "## 3. Solution ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you should code up your model in Julia + JuMP and solve it. Your code should be clean, easy to read, well annotated and commented, and it should compile! You are not allowed to use other programming languages or DCP packages such as `convex.jl`. **I will be running your code**. I suggest having multiple code blocks separated by text blocks that explain the various parts of your solution. You may also solve several versions of your problem with different models/assumptions.\n",
