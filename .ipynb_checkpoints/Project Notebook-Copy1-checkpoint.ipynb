    "City planning is the planning and designing of a city so that it can best control and facilitate economic growth, technological developments, and a sustainable population. Various aspects of city planning include the zoning of land for specific use only, regulating how space is used, what buildings can go on specific plots of land, how many fire and police stations within each block, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2016, Y combinator, one of the biggest tech startup incubator in the world that helped launch companies like Dropbox and Airbnb, announced their project of building the \"New Cities\" project that intended to build a completely new city from scratch.[1] Building a new city from the ground up is not a radically new idea. In 2015, the Egyptian housing minister Mostafa Madbouly announced that they will begin building a new city that is located 45 killometers east of Cairo and outside of the Second Greater Cairo Ring Road.[2] In addition, games such as the SimCity series are primarily based on the concept of urban development and city planning. Whilst not realistic, these games provide a “sandbox” that allows players to create a magic city.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating these magical cities may seem like a simple task, however, when it comes to optimizing the most economically productive or most attractive city, there are many variables to consider. Land, tax rates, budgets, policies, and types of buildings are just a few that must be considered when planning out the “best” metropolis to build. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, we will not be taking into account all of these concerns. Our project will instead be focusing on optimizing simplified magic cities before we try to tackle or discuss future additions or problems for more realistic models.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, however, there are ways we can model a simplified city and project its economic output or attractiveness for people to come and live in it. We can do this starting with the current plot of land or city. From there, we can evaluate its budget based on current economic output and population, and after putting a number to the year’s budget, then we can calculate the value each type of building will bring us. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part of this project, we will be tackling the challange of building the new King Abdullah Economic City.[3] This is a megaproject that was announced by the then-king of Saudi Arabia Al Saud. This project was created to promote industrial expansion, diversify economy, and to provide housing and job opportunities for a yound population. We chose this project because the landarea and the budgets are relatively bigger to work with. The total landarea for this project is around 181km^2 (44726.1 acres), and the intended population is around 2 millions, and the budget is over \\$100 billion dollars. \n",

    "We begin our problem by looking at the city's intended population(P), land developing area(A), and its budget(B). We also generate some data for possible different buildings that can be constructed in this new city. In this simple example, we only taking into considerations some of the absolute essential parts that are needed for a city, for example, homes, schools,fire station, etc.\n",

    "  (A) This constraint ensures that the base city exists in the middle of the map and that the outside (or border) of the world is empty. The base city exists so that the next iteration can grow from it, and the border being empty aids in perimeter calculation in constraint F.\n",

    "  \n",
    "  (E) This is the first nontrivial constraint. It causes a phenomenon of zoning. Zoning is where certain areas of a community are reserved for certain types of buildings. For example, there can be residential zones or business zones. In order to implement this into our example, we ensure that each type of buildings must form a **continguous** area. This is represented in the constraint by not letting type $k$ of a building be built **unless** there is one of type $k$ surrounding it. $W_\\text{inner}$ represents the inner world (i.e. the world without the border). We only sum over these squares since the border is defined to be zero.\n",

    "  (F) This constraint builds upon constraint (E). As a whole, it prevents regions from being strangley shaped by ensuring a proper ratio of perimeter to area. The expression on the left calculates a T dimensional vector representing the perimeter of each of the contiguous building regions. The right side's summation calculates the area of the continguous building regions. The corresponding ratio is represented by $R$."
