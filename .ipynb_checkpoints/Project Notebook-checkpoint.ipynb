    "City planning is the planning and designing of a city so that it can best control and facilitate economic growth, technological developments, and a sustainable population. Various aspects of city planning include the zoning of land for specific use only, regulating how space is used, what buildings can go on specific plots of land, how many fire and police stations within each block, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most well known city planning proposal is the [proposed new capital of Egypt in 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_new_capital_of_Egypt), a proposal to build a new city east of Cairo, Egypt. The major reason for undertaking of this project was to relieve the congestion in Cairo, which was one of the world's most crowded cities. In addition, games such as the SimCity series are primarily based on the concept of urban development and city planning. Whilst not realistic, these games provide a “sandbox” that allows players to create a magic city.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating these magical cities may seem like a simple task, however, when it comes to optimizing the most economically productive or most attractive city, there are many variables to consider. Land, tax rates, budgets, policies, and types of buildings are just a few that must be considered when planning out the “best” metropolis to build. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, we will not be taking into account all of these concerns. Our project will instead be focusing on optimizing simplified magic cities before we try to tackle or discuss future additions or problems for more realistic models.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, however, there are ways we can model a simplified city and project its economic output or attractiveness for people to come and live in it. We can do this starting with the current plot of land or city. From there, we can evaluate its budget based on current economic output and population, and after putting a number to the year’s budget, then we can calculate the value each type of building will bring us. \n",
    "\n",
    "Certain buildings such as houses and schools don’t have much economic output. They do, however, hold a lot of attractive value for people who may want to move in. Similarly, some structures such as coal mines and manufacturing factories may not pull in a large permanent population, but these hold a ton of economic value to the current residents. We also take into consideration the importance of fire and police station for a community, hence optimize so that every block can be covered by a police and fire station.\n",

    "  \n",
    "  $P, A, \\text{and } C$ also represent similar quanitities, where $P = (p_1, p_2, ... p_n)$ and similar for $A$ and $C$. They are also t-dimensional vectors with the ith entry corresponding to the ith type of building. For a given building type i, $c_i$ represents the cost of constructing a building, $p_i$ represents the annual profit, and $a_i$ represents the attractiveness. In our simple model, we measure each of these for a building on a scale from -10 to 10. Negative numbers represent cost rather than profit, and \"ugliness\" rather than attractiveness (note: there cannot be a negative cost for constructing a building).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  $X_{\\text{min}}$ represents the minimum per person requirements for each building. Like $x$, it is t-dimensional for each of the minimum requirements for the t buildings. For clarity, we represent $X_{\\text{min}}$ in number of buildings per 1,000 people. Furthermore, $p$ represents the number of people or population the city must be able to support.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Since our decision variables (the number of buildings) must be positive integers, the problem is a MIP. In our model, we essentially are trying the maximize the annual \"value\" of a city given a certain budget for **completely** constructing it."

The 1 at position $k$ of $w_{i,j}$ indicates that building type $k$ is built at $i,j$. We denote position $k$ of $w_{i,j}$ as $w_{i,j}^k$. We still have a similar $P$ and $A$ matrices.

    "  (A) This constraint ensures that the base city exists in the middle of the map and that the outside (or border) of the world is empty. The base city exists so that the next iteration can grow from it, and the border being empty aids in perimeter calculation in constraint F.\n",

    "  \n",
    "  (E) This is the first nontrivial constraint. It causes a phenomenon of zoning. Zoning is where certain areas of a community are reserved for certain types of buildings. For example, there can be residential zones or business zones. In order to implement this into our example, we ensure that each type of buildings must form a **continguous** area. This is represented in the constraint by not letting type $k$ of a building be built **unless** there is one of type $k$ surrounding it. $W_\\text{inner}$ represents the inner world (i.e. the world without the border). We only sum over these squares since the border is defined to be zero.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  (F) This constraint builds upon constraint (E). As a whole, it prevents regions from being strangley shaped by ensuring a proper ratio of perimeter to area. The expression on the left calculates a T dimensional vector representing the perimeter of each of the contiguous building regions. The right side's summation calculates the area of the continguous building regions. The corresponding ratio is represented by $R$."
